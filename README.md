# PSNebula

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is in early development and is not yet stable!

PSNebula is a minimalist, modern overhaul of the PSP shell experience. The traditional XMB is iconic... but it's showing its age. PSNebula replaces it with a clean, flat interface and a set of kernel modules that slot right into your existing CFW setup, no full firmware replacement required.

## Why?

The PSP still has a thriving homebrew scene, and hardware that holds up well. What hasn't aged as gracefully is the stock XMB experience. PSNebula exists to modernize that experience without asking users to blow away their setup or do anything risky. inspired by projects like [Atmosphère on the Nintendo Switch](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere), the goal is infrastructure that's invisible when it's working and easy to maintain when it's not.

## Goals

- A flat, minimal VSH replacement that feels at home on the PSP's original display
- A small set of kernel modules that handle system-level enhancements
- Simple installation: drop in some binaries, update `plugins.txt`, done
- ARK-4 on 6.61 as the primary supported CFW
- Keep scope honest... this is not a full custom firmware, and doesn't aim to be.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Installation and setup is not tested on non ARK CFW devices, or on non PSP-3000 units.
